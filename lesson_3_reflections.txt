When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you want to collaborate with others, or when you use more than one computer to make changes to your repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To make it less confusing, as well as to make sure that you really want the changes before pulling it to your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - copies entire repository from one github account to another. Clones - copies entire repository from github account to local git. Branches - commits that are separate from the master branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So people can work on it locally, as well as remotely. This will also make merging easier, since they both will have common ancestory. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Send files through dropbox or google drive. It automatically saves changes, but it'll be difficult to merge any branches and changes. Going back to commits with more than one files modified will also be difficult to track.
